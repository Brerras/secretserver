# Introduction

This document provides the details for having Secret Server update the password for Tableau service account.

> **NOTE** TSM utility used for this changer does not report success or failure

> **WARNING** This changer is written up based on documentation, not fully tested.

## Permissions

The utility for updating the service resides on the Tableau server(s). A privileged account for doing a PS remoting session is required, unless the Secret stored for the service has this access.

Authenticating with `tsm` CLI as of 2019.2 release of Tableau Server should not require entering a password if the privileged account has the following permissions:

- Member of the TSM-authorized group, which is the local Administrators group on the Windows computer
- Running the command(s) locally on the Tableau Server that is running the Tableau Server Administration Controller service. By default, the Tableau Server Administration Controller service is installed and configured on the initial node in a distributed deployment.
