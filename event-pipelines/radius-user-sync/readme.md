# Introduction

After an initial synchronization of AD happens, a RADIUS username will always reflect the initial user synchronized from AD.

If the username changes in AD and is synchronized to Secret Server, the username to log in to Secret Server will change, but the RADIUS username will not be updated. This event pipeline ensures that the AD username and RADIUS username are updated to match one another.

## Create Scripts

### Create API Account

This solution will require an application account to be used by the script. The application account will need to have appropriate permissions to modify users. To create a new Application Account, follow these steps:

1. Create a new User Account: Go to **Admin \| Users \| Create New**, then fill in **Names** for the account and click **Advanced*. Check the **Application Account** box and **Save**.
1. Duplicate this account on the Target System. The username should be the same between the two instances.
1. Create a new Role for the API RADIUS Sync User, this role should include the following role permissions: `Administer Users`
1. Assign the Created Role to the API user

### Create Secret for RADIUS User Sync

Populate URL for SS in respective URL Field. A secret using the default Website Template can be leveraged for this pipeline

## Create Event Pipeline Policy

Event Pipelines are a named group of triggers, filters, and tasks to manage events and responses to them. We will use a pipeline to trigger running a script to update the secrets by adding a privileged account upon creation. When creating the Pipeline policy, please configure it as a user policy.

### "Event Pipelines: Allow Confidential Secret Fields to be used in Scripts" Advanced Setting

For the Event Pipeline to function, the advanced setting: "**Event Pipelines: Allow Confidential Secret Fields to be used in Scripts"** must be enabled under the advanced configuration in Secret Server. The application setting will allow confidential secret fields to be used in Event Pipeline scripts, such as \$PASSWORD. The default value is False.

**Note**: Modifying application settings requires an application pool
recycle for on-prem instances.

a.  Go to `https://<SecretServerAddress>/ConfigurationAdvanced.aspx`
b.  Scroll to the bottom and click **Edit**.
c.  Locate the **Event Pipelines: Allow Confidential Secret Fields to be used in Scripts** setting and change the value to **True**
d.  Click the **Save** button.

### Create the Event Pipeline
